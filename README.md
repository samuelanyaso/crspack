# Rank-sum tests for cluster-correlated data

## Description 
This package contains functions to perform inference based on rank-sum statistics for cluster-correlated data with informativeness of the total cluster size, informativeness of a binary covariate distribution or informativeness of a subject-level covariate distribution.

## Installation
The functions require the R packages `Rcpp` and `RcppArmadillo` to be installed.

The `crspack` package can be installed using the `devtools` package:

    library(devtools) 
    devtools::install_github(repo="samuelanyaso/crspack")
